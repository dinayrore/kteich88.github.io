I never felt I had a way with words. I enjoy forming thoughts into phrase and putting pen to the page, but I am known to erase more than I create.

I have been greatly negligent of this blog. I have spent so much time planning out the paragraphs and matching up the dates that I neglected its true purpose. I originally began writing this blog to put into words my experience at The Iron Yard - Durham; to share my newly found knowledge and encourage those going through similar trials and tribulations. I always attempted to have each post circle back to my original intent so that my purpose would not be lost. But, like The Iron Yard itself, I feel this blog has lost its purpose.

I fully intend to continue writing in this blog. I will not guarantee much, but I will be incorporating more aspects of my life into each and every page; tutorials, successes, passions, and struggles.

Life is not a highlight reel like those we see on social media. Life is a journey of ups and downs and all arounds; experiences of joys and sorrows some greater than others. But what we don't always realize, what is the hardest part to comprehend is our capacity to choose, our free will to become one with our problems, or rise up to see the light that lies ahead.

To successfully create this blog, I have been backtracking my experience through my Iron Yard journal and sharing the knowledge therein.  So far so good, right?  No difficulties during my training, no awkward moments or tough spots, just smooth sailing for 12 weeks...  Well, not quite.  I've been honest before in mentioning my moments of weakness, when I felt that maybe I wasn't good enough, or maybe I am not retaining all that I should.  However, these were not the only trials troubling me during those 12 weeks of creating code.  

I'll begin with the importance of communication...

Talk about working with difficult people

Key values you hold dear... Grandma always said "Jesus said 'love one another'"

Qualities of Data Structures, Arrays, Hashes, etc.

Wrap up by mentioning how data structures communicate messages throughout a program and problems may arise, but finding a positive outlet to manage these situations ...something along those lines...

Next issue... While, Until, For, Each, Loops

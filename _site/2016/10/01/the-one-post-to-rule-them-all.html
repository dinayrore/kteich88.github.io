            <p>My first ever blog post! I was very hesitant about constructing a blog. Sure I’ve had Facebook for years; I just started a Twitter; and I had been meaning to start using Instagram more often, but blogging had only ever crossed my mind once (tumblr anyone?). I am a bit of an intro-extrovert. I tend to keep to myself so as not to inconvenience others. I find it hard to trust people and share information for fear that someone might turn my words around and use them against me to either hurt me or hurt others that I love. However, if you ask of me a question, I am sure to tell you about that which you inquired. I won’t hold back. Ask me how I’m feeling and I will be completely honest with you. Why say anything at all if you don’t mean what you say. Anyways, I digress.</p>

<p>My main reason for starting this blog is to document my journey as an up-and-coming Rubyist! To make a very long story as short as possible without missing any crucial details before I decided to embark on this crazy adventure and become a programmer, I was a teacher. Now, don’t get me wrong. I still have a passion for and admire teaching. And I could go on and on about this topic, but I promised to make this short. So, I was advised by a dear friend of mine to try something new (namely coding) and though the thought made me cringe a bit, having invested so much of my life towards teaching, I decided to step out on faith. I moved to a different state for the second time in my life, and signed-up with The Iron Yard where I am currently a member of the super great cohort eight back-end programming Ruby course!</p>

<p>It has only been three weeks, but it has felt like months of knowledge have been siphoned into my brain. Our instructor advised us that within the first week our class had learned approximately 80% of all there is to know about the Ruby language. I couldn’t believe it at the time. It had only been one week how could we have covered so much? I felt uneasy, unsure. <em>There’s no way I can be a programmer</em>, I thought, <em>I just don’t know enough. We’ve already covered 80% of all that we need to know about our core language and yet, I feel as though I know nothing.</em> Within the first three days of the program I posted my progress on FB. Sometimes my posts were positive and outgoing. Sometimes though they were not intended to be, they turned out negative due to my frustration and what seemed to be my lack of ability. Now as I look back at my self and as I continue to grow not only as a programmer but also as a person, I recognize my ability is <strong>great</strong> and I will accomplish <strong>all</strong> things! I am always striving to exceed expectations and level up my abilities. Though there may be doubt at times for I am only human, there is also great hope and faith within me! God has chosen this path for me and I shall follow through. I know that this journey though it has been very difficult at times is all according to His great plan and I look forward to what comes next!</p>

<p>If you are still reading this, God bless! I am so glad that I have not bored you to tears with my incomplete life story and yet I may have left you wondering, <em>well Kristine</em> (that’s my name btw), <em>what exactly have you learned in your first three weeks at The Iron Yard?</em> Well viewer, I am glad you asked. I mentioned before that I had been told that our class had covered approximately 80% of all there is to know about Ruby, which so far includes: Hello World (obviously), conditionals, arrays, loops, functions, file I/O, OOP, RSPEC, classes, inheritance, and this fancy one-liner polymorphism (which btw when broken down means the ability to take on many forms). Not to mention other skills our class practices regularly and have been exposed to respectively such as: pair programming, GitHub workflow, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript, and more recently working with databases.</p>

<p>Well reader I know that’s a lot to digest. It was a lot for me too; and the struggle, the struggle <strong>IS</strong> real! <strong>BUT</strong> I have overcome the obstacle of the unknown! Many of the exercises that stumped me before, over time grew easier. I started to recognize and revise things that once confounded me completely. And spending hours looking over code to fix a simple punctuation error was my life for a moment, but not anymore! I am trying to find a healthy balance between work and play, granted there isn’t much time for anything other than The Iron Yard (lol). But seriously, scheduling more frequent breaks so that I can come back to my code with a fresh set of eyes is something I am doing more often lately. Even though some would think that this practice to be a gross waste of time, I see it as slowly shaving away some of the many wasted hours spent trying to find that tiny little error that I just couldn’t see before.</p>

<p>Recently, I have felt a sense of accomplishment and dare I say, pride when I took some time to look over a particularly perplexing problem and started anew. I modified the entire code and completed epic mode (the highest level of complexity) for this particular assignment. As I pushed my work to GitHub in all of its glory with a well designed README file, a strange sensation filled me. I paused for a moment and thought <em>WOW! Is this how everyone else feels when they exceed their own expectations?</em> The feeling is to great to describe through words, but it is a feeling I am becoming more and more familiar with as I continue coding.</p>

<p>As I mentioned previously, <strong>the struggle is real!</strong> Refactoring code that works is a hard task for me to grasp fully; and throwing out my code completely and starting anew, well that was probably my biggest struggle. Currently, as we are working through databases, I am struggling with proper utilization of the OptionParser class. Not to reiterate refactoring methods that are seemingly too long.</p>

<p>To assist me in my endless struggle, I developed a list. A sort of how to for coding. I recommend that all aspiring coders do the same. The list goes as follows:</p>

<h1 id="how-to-write-code">How to write code</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Accept failure. You’re gonna EFF it up, so EFF it up well!</li>
  <li>Prayer of St. Francis:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>prayer = [‘God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.’]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">things = code if prayer.include?(things)</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Remember GODS PLAN! Try as hard as Rock Lee trains!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="now-real-coding-can-begin">Now real coding can begin</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Look at assignment instructions and list all parts to code.</li>
  <li>Build the smallest, working code first! Don’t stress about the big picture, no methods or classes to start.</li>
  <li>Test &amp; Check! Always try to break your code.</li>
  <li>Refactor, make sure your code is still readable. Test &amp; Check again, and again, and again!</li>
  <li>Be sure to record your successes <strong>AND</strong> failures (so you can learn from each and learn often).</li>
  <li>Always ask questions.</li>
  <li>Keep going! You’re doing great! [Insert other inspiration here]</li>
</ol>

<p>Well this has certainly been an enlightening blog post. I intend to keep up with this as I can throughout my journey, though I cannot promise that all of my posts will be as long. As for my final thoughts, my mission, my motivation, my muse for this off the rails roller coaster ride (no ruby pun intended, seriously): I want to be remembered. I want to be the difference the world needs. I want to make a change so dramatic that the world as we know it stops spinning eastward and rotates in reverse. God has called me to complete this path. His will be done through me for others. I thoroughly enjoy programming and hope to make my future part of the programming world!</p>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<div class="row">
  
    <p>My journey begins as a young and aspiring scientist, hoping to make a difference in the world of education. After five years teaching the young minds of tomorrow, I was enlightened by the prospects of coding.</p>

    <p>With a passion for technology and learning, I completed a full time immersive program at The Iron Yard in Durham, switching careers from full time teacher to full time software engineer.</p>

    <p>I aspire to do God's work as He works through me each and every day. I thrive in meeting challenges and exceeding the highest of expectations. I enjoy learning from experience and sharing my knowledge and passion with others. I want to make the world a better place by being a force of positive change</p>

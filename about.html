## About

My journey begins as a young and aspiring scientist, hoping to make a difference in the world of education. After five years teaching science to the young minds of tomorrow, I was enlightened by the prospects of coding. Having already earned a BSED in Earth &amp; Space Science Secondary Education from WCUPA, I did not want to repeat the same process to learn how to code.

Enter, The Iron Yard! After completing A LOT of research and weighing all my options carefully: I quit my career as an educator moved further south to pursue my dreams through a different light and became a splendid coder. I specialize in Ruby, Rails, and Back-End Engineering, however I also have experience in Front-End and a never-ending desire to learn more!
